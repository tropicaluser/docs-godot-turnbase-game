## Setting up the project

In this short first part, we'll set up and organize the project.

Download turnbased_game_2d_assets.zip. The archive contains a folder `Utility` with the scripts, images and font you'll be using to make the game. Extract the archive and move the art/ and fonts/ directories to your project's directory.


Launch Godot and create a new project.
