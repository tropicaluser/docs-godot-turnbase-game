Next open "NewProjectInitializer.tscn" in "Utility" folder. If you click on "Output"
at bottom you will see the text. 

> NewProjectInitalizer has completed. Comment out its "tool" line when done.

This means the script has setup default settings in the project. Close "NewProjectInitalizer.tscn"

## Validate Script was run successfully

In NewProjectInitializer.gd on line 5 we have the text.

> ProjectSettings.set_setting("display/window/size/width", 320)

To validate the script. At top click Project - Project Settings.

Under Display - Window we can see that the width is set to 320. Meaning the script 
has run successfully.
