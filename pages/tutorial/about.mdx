## Setting up the project

In this short first part, we'll set up and organize the project.

Download turnbased_game_2d_assets.zip. The archive contains a folder `Utility` with the scripts, images and font you'll be using to make the game. Extract the archive and move the art/ and fonts/ directories to your project's directory.


Launch Godot and create a new project.

Rename Control to "Battle".

To add a background node below Battle we click "+" symbol and type 
"colorrect".

### Setup Project Initializer (Use Utlity Folder)

Let's add the Utility folder. Right-click on "res://" and select "Open in File Manager". Name the folder "Utility".

![Alt text](../../images/02-battle-scene-06.png)

Unzip `turnbased_game_2d_assets.zip`. Move "Utility" folder from zip-file into the project folder.

![Alt text](../../images/02-battle-scene-07.png)

We gonna run a script to set default settings in the project. Open "NewProjectInitializer.gd" 
in "Utility" folder. uncomment the tool at the top. click `ctrl + s` to Save.

![Alt text](../../images/02-battle-scene-08.png)

Next open "NewProjectInitializer.tscn" in "Utility" folder. If you click on "Output"
at bottom you will see the text. 

> NewProjectInitalizer has completed. Comment out its "tool" line when done.

This means the script has setup default settings in the project. Close "NewProjectInitalizer.tscn"
with the "X" at top. 

![Alt text](../../images/02-battle-scene-09.png)

Next, comment out the "tool" line in "NewProjectInitializer.gd" and save the file
with `ctrl + s`.

### Validate Script was run successfully

In NewProjectInitializer.gd on line 5 we have the text.

> ProjectSettings.set_setting("display/window/size/width", 320)

To validate the script. At top click Project - Project Settings.

![Alt text](../../images/02-battle-scene-11.png)

Under Display - Window we can see that the width is set to 320. Meaning the script 
has run successfully.
